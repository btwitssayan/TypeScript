# Installing TypeScript Type Definitions

If a package doesn't have built-in TypeScript declarations, install the types package:

npm i -D @types/package-name

Examples:
- npm i -D @types/node
- npm i -D @types/react
- npm i -D @types/jest

The -D flag installs it as a dev dependency since types are only needed during development.
